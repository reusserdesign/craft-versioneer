# Versioneer Craft Plugin

This plugin adds a really simple _Version History_ field type that you can add to an entry to display its version history—or at least the most recent 500 versions compared to the 10 that Craft displays.

## Setup

Copy the versioneer folder to your Craft plugin directory, and install it from the control panel (Settings → Plugins).

Create a "Version History" field and add it to the field layouts of whichever sections you'd like. It's best to put the field in its own tab.

Be sure that _Enable versioning for entries in this section?_ is switched on for each relevant section, or there won't ever be any history to display. That'd be preposterous.
